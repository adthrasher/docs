Will I be charged for using St. Jude Cloud?
-------------------------------------------

Although you may be prompted to enter billing information, you will not be charged for
anything with the exception of the following items:

* If you run the :ref:`warden-index` tool, the :ref:`chipseq-index` tool
  (broad or narrow), the :ref:`rapid-rnaseq-index` tool, or the :ref:`neoepitope-index` tool,
  you will be charged for the compute resources used in producing the results as well as storage
  fees associated with storing the results files.
* Any copy of the St. Jude data you receive is considered "sponsored", so you do not have to pay
  a fee to store this data in St. Jude Cloud. You will be charged for any *derivative* files
  obtained through running analyses on St. Jude data and stored on the St. Jude Cloud.
