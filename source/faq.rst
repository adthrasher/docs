Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Will I be charged for using St. Jude Cloud?
-------------------------------------------

Although you may be prompted to enter billing information, you will not be charged for
anything with the exception of the following items:

* If you elect to *download* any data from SJCloud, you will be charged an egress fee by DNAnexus.
  This fee is usually negligible unless you are downloading entire cohorts. We are actively 
  investigating ways to minimize or eliminate these costs.
* If you run the :ref:`warden-index` tool, the :ref:`chipseq-index` tool
  (broad or narrow), the :ref:`rapid-rnaseq-index` tool, or the :ref:`neoepitope-index` tool,
  you will be charged for the compute resources used in producing the results as well as storage
  fees associated with storing the results files.
* Any copy of the St. Jude data you receive is considered "sponsored", so you do not have to pay
  a fee to store this data in St. Jude Cloud. You will be charged for any *derivative* files
  obtained through running analyses on St. Jude data and stored on the St. Jude Cloud.
