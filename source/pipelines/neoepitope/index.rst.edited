   <h2>Introduction</h2>

Cancers are caused by somatically acquired alterations including
single nucleotide variations (SNVs), small insertion/deletions (indels),
translocations, and other types of rearrangements. The genes affected by these
mutations may produce altered proteins, some of which may lead to the emergence
of tumor-specific immunogenic epitopes. We developed an analytical workflow for
identification of putative neoepitopes based on somatic missense mutations and
gene fusions using whole genome sequencing data. The workflow has been used to
characterize neoepitope landscape of 23 subtypes of pediatric cancer in the
Pediatric Cancer Genome Project (PCGP)[1].

   <h2>Overview</h2>

stjude-hlatyping
  The stjude-hlatype applet is used for predict the HLA class I alleles. User
  can select to provide fastq (paired or single end reads) or BAM file as input.
  When using BAMs as input, the reads surrounding the HLA loci and unmapped
  reads will be extracted. The reads will be fed into Optitype for HLA typing.
  The default setting of Optitype is used. The output of the HLA type can be
  combined with the stjude-epitope app (see below) to perform affinity
  prediction of neoepitopes.
 
stjude-epitope
   The stjude-epitope applet is used to extract peptides covering
   an array of tiling peptides (size defined by users) overlapping each missense
   mutation or gene fusion. Fusion junctions can be identified using RNAseq by
   CICERO (Li et al. unpublished data). NetMHCcons (Karosiene et al.) is
   subsequently used to predict affinities of the peptide array for each HLA
   receptor in each sample. The neoepitope with affinity lower than the threshold
   will be highlighted in output file (default 500 nM).
