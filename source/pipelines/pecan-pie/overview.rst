An overview of the PeCan-PIE workflow:

1. log in and upload a VCF of SNVs and indels

2. variants are annotated with VEP+ (VEP with postprocessing for enhanced splice variant calling) and classified with Medal Ceremony

3. browse results, including a detailed page for each variation.  Variants may be formally classified with an interface based on ACMG guidelines.
