   Class, "Predicted effect of variant on protein coding, e.g. missense, nonsense, etc."
   Committee Classification, "If the variant has been reviewed by the St. Jude germline variant review committee, the result will appear in this column, otherwise it will be blank."
   Somatic medal, "Medal assigned to the variant by the somatic classifier."
