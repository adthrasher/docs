St. Jude Internal Employee Guide
================================

The main difference between using SJCloud as an external user vs. a St. Jude employee
is the way that you log into the system --- St. Jude employees may log in with their St.
Jude username and password, so they must visit a special webpage to authenticate. This
process is extremely arbitrary, and we are in the process of making SJ authentication
work through the main webpage.

Logging In
----------

1. Navigate to https://cloud.stjude.org.
2. Enter your St. Jude username and password and click "Submit".
3. After authenticating, your website address bar should read ``https://platform.dnanexus.com/`` and
   look similar to the following image.

4. If done correctly, your name should be visible in the top right of the toolbar. You can now :underline:`close this browser tab`.
5. In a fresh browser tab, navigate to https://stjude.cloud.
6. Click on one of "Data", "Tools", or "Visualizations", whichever you are interested in. In this example, I clicked on "Tools".
7. If you were not already logged in, you should see a "User" button in the top right of the toolbar.
   Click this, then select "Log in with DNAnexus" from the menu.

8. You should be authenticated using account you entered in step #2 and automatically returned to the page you logged in
   from. If you have done this correctly, your name should appear in the top right of the screen.
