Analysis of Results
===================

.. note:: Navigating to the results section of the tool is covered in :ref:`chip-seq-results-navigation`.

Raw Results
-----------

For the ChIP-Seq pipeline, all results are distributed in the :code:`Results` folder.
Underneath this folder, you will see all of the runs you've completed, sorted
by the output prefix you specified in :ref:`chipseq-parameter-config`.

The exact content of the output folder changes as the version of the pipeline 
updates. Please refer to the :code:`README.txt` found in the output folder
for your run for the most up to date information on raw outputs.

ProteinPaint Visualization
--------------------------

The ProteinPaint visualization is currently being implemented.
