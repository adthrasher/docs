   <h2>Introduction</h2>

Cancers are caused by somatically acquired alterations including
single nucleotide variations (SNVs), small insertion/deletions (indels),
translocations, and other types of rearrangements. The genes affected by these
mutations may produce altered proteins, some of which may lead to the emergence
of tumor-specific immunogenic epitopes. We developed an analytical workflow for
identification of putative neoepitopes based on somatic missense mutations and
gene fusions using whole genome sequencing data. The workflow has been used to
characterize neoepitope landscape of 23 subtypes of pediatric cancer in the
Pediatric Cancer Genome Project [1]_.
