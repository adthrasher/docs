Navigating Results
=====================

.. note:: Navigating to the raw results of your runs is the
          same for all pipelines. This guide will feature
          the :ref:`rapid-rnaseq` pipeline, but you can follow
          along for any tool.

Raw result files
----------------

Navigate to your tool's description page (for instance,
Rapid RNA-Seq's description page is `here <https://platform.stjude.cloud/tools/10>`_).
You should see a screen similar to the one in the screenshot below.
In the left hand pane, select "View Results Files".

.. image:: ../../resources/raw-results.png
   :alt: Click "View Results Files"

You should now be in the tool's workspace with access to files that
you uploaded and results files that are generated. How/where the result
files are generated are specific to each pipeline. Please refer to your
individual pipeline's documentation on where the output files are kept.
