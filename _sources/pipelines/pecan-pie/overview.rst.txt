Overview
========

An overview of the PeCan-PIE workflow:

1. log in and upload a VCF of SNVs and indels.

2. The portal will process your variants, notifying you upon completion.  Variants are annotated with VEP+ (VEP with postprocessing for enhanced splice variant calling) then classified with Medal Ceremony.

3. browse results, which include a detailed page for each variation.  Variants may be formally classified with an interface based on ACMG guidelines.
