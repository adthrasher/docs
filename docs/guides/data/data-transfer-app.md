## Introduction

The St. Jude Cloud data transfer application is still under development.
Please refer to the [command line interaction guide](./command-line.md) for the official 
documentation on how to upload data to or download download data from St. Jude Cloud
Platform.

If you are adventurous, we welcome you to try out the experience by
[downloading the latest release](https://dta.stjude.cloud) and letting
us know how it goes! You can find the source code
