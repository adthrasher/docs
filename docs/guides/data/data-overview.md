### Embargo dates

An embargo date is the time at which access to data is allowed to users
for publishing purposes. Typically, samples from the same Data Access
Unit all have the same embargo date, as they are usually released on St.
Jude Cloud at the same time. Publishing any results derived from this data 
before this embargo date is not permitted as outlined in the data access agreement.

**Current Embargo Dates**

| Data Access Unit | Embargo Date | 
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Pediatric Cancer Genome Project | July 23, 2018 | 
| St. Jude LIFE | January 15, 2019 |
| Clinical Genomics | January 15, 2019 |
