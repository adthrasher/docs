You can follow [this guide](guides/data/data-request.md) to request access to
St. Jude data in a secure cloud environment. Before you can begin writing your
own tools to run against our data, you'll need to understand a bit about how
data vending in St. Jude Cloud works. Behind the scenes, the [DNAnexus](https://www.dnanexus.com/) genomic ecosystem is the backbone for the computation
and storage in St. Jude Cloud. Each data request in St. Jude Cloud corresponds to a project in DNAnexus. We'll explain what this means below, but if you're so inclined, you can read an introduction to their ecosystem [here](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/UI/Quickstart).

## Accessing your data

Once your data access request is approved, the data you requested from St. Jude will automatically be distributed to a DNAnexus project with the same name as your data request.
