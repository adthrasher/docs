## Introduction

An embargo date is the time at which access to data is allowed to users
for publishing purposes. Typically, samples from the same Data Access
Unit all have the same embargo date, as they are usually released on St.
Jude Cloud at the same time. Publishing data before this embargo date is
not permitted, and documentation can be found in the
[complete-daa]{role="ref"}.

## Frequently asked questions

`SAMPLE_INFO.txt` file that is included with each data request.
